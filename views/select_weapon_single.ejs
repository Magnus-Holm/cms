        <p>
            <strong>Damage:</strong>
            <br>
            The Damage stat dictates how much damage the weapon does. The Damage stats for a weapon are W / X / Y / Z:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    W is Physical Damage
                </li>
                <li>
                    X is Magical Damage
                </li>
                <li>
                    Y is Fire Damage
                </li>
                <li>
                    Z is Lightning Damage
                </li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <!-- Add AUX key -->
        <p>
            <strong>Damage Reduction %:</strong>
            <br>
            The Damage Reduction stat dictates the percentage of damage reduced while blocking. The Damage Reduction
            stats
            for a weapon are W / X / Y / Z:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    W is the Physical Damage Reduction
                </li>
                <li>
                    X is the Magical Damage Reduction
                </li>
                <li>
                    Y is the Fire Damage Reduction
                </li>
                <li>
                    Z is the Lightning Damage Reduction
                </li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Critical:</strong>
            <br>
            The damage bonus for backstabs and ripostes. Thrusting Swords and Daggers get
            an invisible bonus
            to
            critical damage as well.
        </p>
        <p>

            <strong>Durability:</strong>
            <br>
            The health of the weapon. The effectiveness of the weapon will severely
            deteriorate when the
            durability falls below 30%.
        </p>
        <!-- Add Range key -->
        <p>
            <strong>Stability:</strong>
            <br>
            The stability of the weapon. The higher this value, the less stamina is
            consumed when blocking
            attacks.
        </p>
        <p>

            <strong>Weight:</strong>
            <br>
            The weight of the weapon. Note that carrying over 50% of a character's Equip
            Burden will reduce the
            speed of their rolls, while going over 100% will reduce their regular speed to walking and attempts to roll
            or
            backstep will leave them momentarily stunned.
        </p>
        <p>

            <strong>Stats Needed:</strong>
            <br>
            The Stats Needed determines how high various Stats must be in order to wield the weapon effectively. The
            Requirement stats for a weapon are W / X / Y / Z:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    W is the Strength required
                </li>
                <li>
                    X is the Dexterity required
                </li>
                <li>
                    Y is the Intelligence required
                </li>
                <li>
                    Z is the Faith required
                </li>
            </ul>
            Wielding a weapon without the required Strength and/or Dexterity will incur a penalty to the Physical
            damage of
            the weapon, while lower-than-required Magic and/or Faith will reduce the Magic damage of the weapon.
            <br>
            <br>
            Also keep in mind that a character gains a 50% bonus to Strength by wielding a weapon with both hands, thus
            reducing the actual Strength required.
            For example, a character with 18 Strength can wield a Large Club (Requires 26 Strength) properly if the
            weapon
            is held with both hands.
            (18 x 1.5 = 27)
